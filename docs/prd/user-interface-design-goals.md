# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The user experience for flow.dev's interface will be **clean, direct, and professional**. The primary goal is to enable a new user to connect their tools and start receiving value with the least possible friction. The design should prioritize clarity and efficiency over aesthetic complexity.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

For the MVP, interactions will be based on standard, universally understood web patterns. This includes simple form inputs, clear button actions (e.g., "Connect GitHub," "Save Configuration"), and straightforward navigation. There will be no complex or novel interaction models to learn.

## Core Screens and Views

1.  **Onboarding & Configuration Screen**: A single, primary screen where users can authenticate with GitHub and input their configuration details (e.g., recipient email). This screen will provide clear feedback on the connection status.
2.  **Dashboard/Status Screen**: A simple landing page users see after successfully configuring their account. For the MVP, this may simply confirm that the setup is complete and that they will receive their first report on the next cycle.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The interface will be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

## Branding

Branding elements (logo, color palette, typography) are to be determined. The initial implementation will use a minimalist, neutral design palette that can be easily updated with official brand assets later.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The configuration interface will be a responsive web application, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile browsers.
