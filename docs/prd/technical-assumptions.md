# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo

The project will be housed in a single monorepo.

* **Rationale**: For an MVP with a small, focused team, a monorepo simplifies dependency management and allows for easy sharing of code and types between the frontend UI and any backend services (e.g., sharing data models), which significantly increases development velocity.

### Service Architecture: Serverless

The application will be built using a serverless architecture.

* **Rationale**: This approach minimizes operational overhead and infrastructure management, allowing the team to focus on feature development. It is cost-effective (pay-per-use) and scales automatically, which is ideal for a new product with unpredictable load. The passive, scheduled nature of the core analysis task is a perfect fit for a serverless function (cron job).

### Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration

The testing strategy will focus on a combination of unit tests and integration tests.

* **Rationale**: This provides a strong balance for an MVP. Unit tests will ensure individual components and functions are correct, while integration tests will verify that critical workflows, like connecting to the GitHub API and running the analysis engine, work end-to-end. A full end-to-end (E2E) test suite is deferred post-MVP to maintain development speed.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

* **Core Technology Stack**: We will use a modern, TypeScript-first stack: **Next.js** for the framework and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
* **Deployment Target**: The application will be deployed to **Vercel**.
* **Database & Auth**: The project will use **Supabase** (PostgreSQL), specifically leveraging the **`@supabase/ssr`** library for server-side rendering integration.
* **Database Toolkit**: Database interactions will be managed using **Drizzle ORM**.
* **UI Animation**: Animations and micro-interactions will be implemented using **Framer Motion**.
* **UI Component Library**: The project will use the **HeroUI** library for pre-built React components.
