# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

* Enable engineering managers to make data-driven decisions regarding team performance and project health.
* Uncover and identify hidden bottlenecks within the development lifecycle, such as slow code reviews or excessive rework.
* Proactively mitigate project risks by delivering real-time, actionable alerts to team leads.
* Empower managers to effectively coach and improve their teams using concrete, objective data.
* Automate administrative work for developers by providing auto-generated summaries of their contributions.

## Background Context

Currently, many engineering leaders rely on subjective feedback and intuition to manage their teams, leading to several critical pain points. Hidden inefficiencies like slow code reviews remain unquantified, and project risks are often only discovered after they've caused significant delays. This reactive, "firefighting" approach is compounded by time-consuming and often biased manual status reporting.

"flow.dev" addresses this by integrating directly with a team's existing tools (e.g., GitHub, Jira) to passively analyze development signals. Its core AI engine will interpret metrics like PR Cycle Time and Ticket Flow Efficiency to generate actionable insights. These insights will be proactively delivered to managers through channels like email and Slack, shifting them from a reactive to a proactive management style without altering developer workflows.
