# Story 1.2: User Sign-up & Database Integration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** new User,
**I want** to sign up for the application using my email and password,
**so that** my user account is created and persisted.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A sign-up page is created using HeroUI components with fields for email and password.
2. User input is validated on the client and server.
3. Upon successful submission, a new user record is created in the Supabase `auth.users` table.
4. The user is redirected to a placeholder dashboard page upon successful sign-up.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 implementation:
- Successfully upgraded to Tailwind CSS v4 and HeroUI v2.8.4 for better compatibility
- HeroUI Provider already configured in `/apps/web/src/app/providers.tsx`
- Monorepo structure established with apps/web for Next.js application
- Using Next.js App Router (not Pages Router) for all routing

### Project Structure
All new code for this story goes in `apps/web/` directory [Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]:
- Authentication pages: `/apps/web/src/app/auth/signup/`
- Dashboard pages: `/apps/web/src/app/dashboard/`
- Utilities: `/apps/web/src/app/utils/supabase/`
- Shared types can go in `/packages/shared-types/` if needed

### Tech Stack Requirements
Must use these exact versions [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]:
- @supabase/ssr: 0.3.0 (for server-side auth)
- Supabase: 1.165.0 (main client library)
- HeroUI: 2.8.4 (already installed, use for all UI components)
- Next.js: 14.2.3 (already configured)
- Tailwind CSS: 4.0.0 (already upgraded in Story 1.1)

### Data Models
UserProfile model that extends Supabase auth.users [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#user-profile]:
```typescript
export interface UserProfile {
  id: string; // UUID - references auth.users(id)
  updated_at: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp
  report_email: string | null;
}
```
Note: The UserProfile will be created in a later story. This story only creates the auth.users record.

### Database Schema
The app.user_profiles table structure (for reference - created later) [Source: architecture/9-database-schema.md]:
```sql
CREATE TABLE app.user_profiles (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
    report_email text,
    github_token_encrypted text
);
```
Note: This story only creates the Supabase auth.users entry. The user_profiles table will be handled in a subsequent story.

### Authentication Workflow
User sign-up flow from architecture [Source: architecture/8-core-workflows.md#user-onboarding-github-connection]:
1. User visits site and signs up (this story)
2. Next.js App creates user account in Supabase
3. User is redirected to dashboard
(GitHub connection and further steps handled in later stories)

### Component Specifications
Frontend components from architecture [Source: architecture/6-components.md#frontend-components]:
- **AuthUI:** Manages the user authentication experience (sign-up, sign-in, etc.)
  - This story implements the sign-up portion of AuthUI
  - Use HeroUI components for consistent design
  - Follow existing provider setup from Story 1.1

### Core Services
Authentication management [Source: architecture/6-components.md#core-services]:
- **AuthManager:** Manages user sessions and authentication state using Supabase Auth
  - Implement using @supabase/ssr for server-side session management
  - Create reusable Supabase client utilities

### API Specification
While not directly used in this story, future API will use cookie-based auth [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]:
- Security scheme uses `sb-access-token` cookie
- User profile endpoints will be at `/api/user/profile`

### Testing Requirements
Based on tech stack [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]:
- Unit Testing: Jest & React Testing Library (29.7.0)
- Integration Testing: Playwright (1.44.0)
- Test files should follow Next.js conventions
- Place unit tests next to components (e.g., `signup.test.tsx`)
- Place integration tests in `apps/web/tests/` or `apps/web/e2e/`
