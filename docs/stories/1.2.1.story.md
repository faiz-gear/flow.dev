# Story 1.2.1: User Sign-in & Session Management

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** returning User,
**I want** to sign in to the application using my email and password,
**so that** I can access my dashboard and account features.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A sign-in page is created using HeroUI components with fields for email and password.
2. User input is validated on the client and server.
3. Upon successful authentication, the user session is established and they are redirected to the dashboard.
4. Invalid credentials display clear error messages without revealing whether email exists.
5. The landing page provides navigation to both sign-up and sign-in pages.
6. Already authenticated users are redirected away from sign-in page to dashboard.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 1.1 and 1.2 implementation:
- Supabase authentication infrastructure already configured with @supabase/ssr v0.3.0
- HeroUI Provider configured in `/apps/web/src/app/providers.tsx`
- Tailwind CSS v4 upgraded and working
- Supabase client utilities exist in `/apps/web/src/app/utils/supabase/`
- Auth session middleware configured in `/apps/web/src/middleware.ts`
- Dashboard page exists with auth protection at `/apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Landing page exists at `/apps/web/src/app/components/LandingPage.tsx`

### Project Structure
All new code for this story goes in `apps/web/` directory [Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]:
- Sign-in page: `/apps/web/src/app/auth/signin/`
- Reuse existing utilities: `/apps/web/src/app/utils/supabase/`
- Update landing page: `/apps/web/src/app/components/LandingPage.tsx`
- Tests: `/apps/web/src/app/auth/signin/__tests__/` and `/apps/web/tests/e2e/`

### Tech Stack Requirements
Must use these exact versions [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]:
- @supabase/ssr: 0.3.0 (already configured for server-side auth)
- Supabase: 1.165.0 (main client library, already installed)
- HeroUI: 2.1.1 (use for all UI components)
- Next.js: 14.2.3 (App Router already configured)
- Tailwind CSS: 3.4.3 (already upgraded in previous stories)

### Authentication Workflow
Sign-in flow extends existing auth workflow [Source: architecture/8-core-workflows.md#user-onboarding-github-connection]:
1. User visits landing page
2. User clicks "Sign In" link
3. User enters email and password on sign-in page
4. Form validates input client-side
5. Server action authenticates with Supabase Auth
6. On success: establish session and redirect to dashboard
7. On failure: display appropriate error message

### Component Specifications
Frontend components from architecture [Source: architecture/6-components.md#frontend-components]:
- **AuthUI**: Manages the user authentication experience (sign-up, sign-in, etc.)
  - This story implements the sign-in portion of AuthUI
  - Reuse patterns from sign-up implementation in Story 1.2
  - Use HeroUI components for consistent design
  - Follow existing provider setup

### Core Services
Authentication management [Source: architecture/6-components.md#core-services]:
- **AuthManager**: Manages user sessions and authentication state using Supabase Auth
  - Reuse existing Supabase client utilities from Story 1.2
  - Use @supabase/ssr for server-side session management
  - Leverage existing middleware for auth session handling

### Security Considerations
- Implement rate limiting for sign-in attempts to prevent brute force attacks
- Use generic error messages to avoid user enumeration attacks
- Ensure HTTPS for all authentication flows in production
- Validate all inputs on both client and server side
- Clear sensitive form data after failed attempts
- Implement proper CSRF protection using Supabase's built-in mechanisms

### User Experience Patterns
- Consistent styling and layout with sign-up page
- Clear navigation between sign-up and sign-in flows
- Helpful error messages without security vulnerabilities
- Loading states during authentication process
- Redirect handling for deep linking after authentication
- Remember me functionality for user convenience

### Testing Requirements
Based on tech stack [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]:
- Unit Testing: Jest & React Testing Library (29.7.0)
- Integration Testing: Playwright (1.44.0)
- Test sign-in flow end-to-end including error scenarios
- Test form validation and error handling
- Test navigation and redirect behavior
- Mock Supabase responses for testing
- Test authenticated user redirect logic

### Testing Standards
- Place unit tests next to components (e.g., `signin.test.tsx`)
- Place integration tests in `apps/web/tests/e2e/` directory
- Use Jest for validation and auth function testing
- Use Playwright for full sign-in flow testing
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Ensure tests work with mocked Supabase responses

### Integration Points
- Landing page needs sign-in navigation link
- Dashboard auth protection should work seamlessly
- Middleware should handle session verification
- Sign-up and sign-in pages should cross-reference each other
- Error handling should be consistent across auth flows
