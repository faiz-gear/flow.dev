# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Initial Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a new Next.js project initialized with the specified tech stack and deployed to Vercel,
**so that** I have a stable foundation to build features upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Next.js monorepo is created and pushed to a Git repository.
2. All specified dependencies (`@supabase/ssr`, Drizzle, HeroUI, Framer Motion) are installed and configured.
3. The project is successfully connected and deployed to a Vercel project.
4. The default Vercel deployment URL loads a simple, placeholder "Welcome to flow.dev" page.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story - this is the first story of the project.

### Project Structure
The project uses a monorepo structure with npm workspaces [Source: architecture/10-unified-project-structure.md]:
```
flow-dev/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/                # Next.js frontend and user-facing API
│   └── cron/               # Backend data processing functions
├── packages/
│   ├── db/                 # Drizzle ORM schema and database client
│   ├── shared-types/       # Shared TypeScript interfaces
│   └── config/             # Shared configs (ESLint, etc.)
├── package.json            # Root workspaces config
└── README.md
```

### Tech Stack Requirements
All dependencies must use these exact versions [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]:
- Next.js: 14.2.3
- Tailwind CSS: 3.4.3
- HeroUI: 2.1.1
- Framer Motion: 11.1.9
- Supabase: 1.165.0
- Drizzle ORM: 0.30.10
- @supabase/ssr: 0.3.0
- Jest & RTL: 29.7.0
- Playwright: 1.44.0
- ESLint: 9.2.0
- Prettier: 3.2.5

### Architecture Patterns
[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#architectural-and-design-patterns]:
- **Serverless Architecture**: All backend logic will be hosted in Vercel Functions
- **Jamstack**: Frontend will be pre-rendered static assets where possible
- **Repository Pattern**: Backend data access will be abstracted for modularity
- **Monorepo Tool**: npm workspaces for lightweight workspace management

### Deployment Configuration
[Source: architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#platform-and-infrastructure-choice]:
- **Platform**: Vercel for hosting, serverless functions, and cron jobs
- **Edge Network**: Vercel's global edge network for frontend delivery
- The frontend will connect to Supabase for database and authentication (configured in later stories)

### Testing
Testing frameworks specified in tech stack [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]:
- Unit Testing: Jest & React Testing Library (29.7.0)
- Integration Testing: Playwright (1.44.0)
- Test files should follow Next.js conventions
- No specific testing requirements for this initial scaffolding story
