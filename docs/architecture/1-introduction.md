# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **"flow.dev"**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD, this is a greenfield project built on a modern, specific tech stack (Next.js, Vercel, Supabase). To accelerate setup and ensure best practices from the start, I recommend using the official **Vercel Next.js starter template combined with the Supabase integration template**.

  * **Rationale**: This approach provides a pre-configured, production-ready foundation that includes server-side rendering (`@supabase/ssr`), environment variable setup, and authentication helpers. It directly aligns with the PRD's technical assumptions while saving significant initial setup time.
