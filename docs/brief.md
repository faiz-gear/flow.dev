### 1. Executive Summary (TL;DR)

The biggest black box in modern software development is the engineering process itself. Engineering managers often lack the objective data needed to understand team velocity, identify hidden bottlenecks, and proactively flag project risks. "Momentum" is an engineering insight platform that connects to a team's existing tools like GitHub/GitLab and Jira/Linear. It **passively collects** development data and uses an AI-driven engine to generate **actionable insights**. We are not just another dashboard; we are the diagnostic tool for high-performing engineering teams.

### 2. Problem Statement

Engineering leaders (Managers, Tech Leads, VPs) face critical pain points that hinder their teams' effectiveness:

* **Decisions Based on Gut Feel**: Key questions like "Is our team's velocity improving?" or "Why was this project delayed?" are answered with intuition and subjective feedback from meetings, not objective data.
* **Hidden Bottlenecks**: Inefficiencies like slow code reviews, excessive rework, and knowledge silos are buried in daily workflows, making them difficult to quantify and address.
* **Reactive Risk Management**: Problems are often identified only after they have already caused significant delays or quality issues, forcing teams into a constant "firefighting" mode.
* **Ineffective Reporting**: Traditional status updates rely on manual, self-reported data, which is often biased, time-consuming to prepare, and fails to reflect the true health of a project.

### 3. Proposed Solution

Momentum transforms raw development data into a clear, actionable signal through a three-step process:

1.  **Frictionless Integration**
    * Connects securely via OAuth to a team's code repositories (GitHub, GitLab) and project management tools (Jira, Linear) with **read-only access**.
    * This process is entirely automated and requires **no change to developer workflows**.

2.  **Intelligent Signal Analysis**
    * Our core engine continuously analyzes key engineering signals, including:
        * **PR Cycle Time**: The total time from the first commit to deployment, broken down into phases like Time to First Review, Rework Time, and Idle Time.
        * **Ticket Flow Efficiency**: The time tickets spend in each stage of the development process, identifying where work gets stuck.
        * **Development Health**: Metrics such as PR rework rate, CI/CD failure frequency, and code churn.

3.  **Proactive Insight Delivery**
    * Instead of requiring users to log in and search for data, we push the most critical insights directly to managers where they work.
    * **Channels**: A weekly "Team Health" digest via email and real-time risk alerts via Slack/Teams.
    * **Examples**:
        > "ALERT: PR #256 has been awaiting review for over 48 hours (3x the team average) and is now a risk for the **Payments Module** release."
        >
        > "WEEKLY INSIGHT: Your team's median PR Cycle Time was 52 hours last week. **60% of that time was spent waiting for review**, with **Engineer A** being the primary bottleneck."

### 4. Target Audience

* **Economic Buyer & Primary User**:
    * Engineering Manager
    * VP of Engineering / Director of Engineering
    * Tech Lead / Team Lead

* **Secondary Beneficiaries**:
    * **Developers**: They benefit from optimized processes, gain data-backed visibility for their contributions, and are freed from manual status reporting through automated work summaries.

### 5. Value Proposition

**For Managers:**
* ✅ **Make Data-Driven Decisions**: Replace guesswork with objective insights about your team's performance.
* ✅ **Uncover Hidden Bottlenecks**: Instantly identify the root causes of delays in your development lifecycle.
* ✅ **Mitigate Project Risks**: Shift from reactive problem-solving to proactive risk prevention with real-time alerts.
* ✅ **Coach and Improve Your Team**: Use concrete data to have more effective 1-on-1s and drive process improvements.

**For Developers:**
* ✅ **Automate Admin Work**: Get auto-generated, objective summaries of work based on Git and Jira activity, eliminating the need to write status reports.
* ✅ **Gain Visibility for Your Work**: Ensure contributions like code reviews and complex problem-solving are visible and quantified.
* ✅ **Remove Blockers**: Help the team identify and resolve systemic issues that impede their workflow.

### 6. Go-to-Market Strategy & MVP Plan

We will follow a lean, phased approach to validate and build the product:

* **Phase 1: Problem Validation**
    * **Goal**: Confirm that this is a high-value problem for engineering managers with a clear willingness to pay.
    * **Action**: Conduct 10-15 in-depth interviews with target users. Present mockups of the insight reports to test the value proposition.

* **Phase 2: Concierge MVP**
    * **Goal**: Manually deliver value to 1-2 pilot teams to prove the solution's effectiveness.
    * **Action**: Gain read-only access to a team's repository. Manually run analysis scripts each week and personally write and send the insight email. Observe if the insights lead to real-world actions.

* **Phase 3: Lean MVP**
    * **Goal**: Build the first automated version of the product.
    * **Scope**:
        * **Integration**: GitHub only.
        * **Analysis**: PR Cycle Time as the single core metric.
        * **Output**: A weekly, automated email report.
        * **UI**: A minimal onboarding and configuration interface.

### 7. Success Metrics

* **North Star Metric**: Number of insights acted upon or discussed by a manager per week.
* **Business Metrics**: Conversion rate from trial to paid, number of active paying teams, Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR).
* **Product Metrics**: User retention (teams remain connected), email open and click-through rates.

### 8. Risks & Challenges

* **Data Security & Trust**: (High) - **Mitigation**: Strictly enforce read-only permissions, achieve security certifications (e.g., SOC 2), and be transparent about data handling.
* **Accuracy & Value of Insights**: (Medium) - **Mitigation**: Co-create the analysis model with pilot users during the Concierge MVP phase to ensure insights are valuable, not noisy.
* **Market Education**: (Medium) - **Mitigation**: Focus initial messaging on solving one highly-relatable pain point (e.g., "fix slow code reviews") to establish a beachhead before expanding the vision.
